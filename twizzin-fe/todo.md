refactor after MVP:

- accept SPL tokens - change in create game and JoinComponent
- delete game from db and on-chain before game ever starts
- handle retrieving several games in state at once, differentiating them by gameCode or id
- handle editing a game
- create routes for games after creation /create/[gameId]
- add supabase domain to next.config.mjs for image hosting
